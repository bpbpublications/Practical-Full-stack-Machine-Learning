# Practical Full Stack Machine Learning

Master the ML process, from pipeline development to model deployment in production

This is the repository for [Practical Full Stack Machine Learning
](https://bpbonline.com/products/building-production-ready-web-apps-with-node-js?_pos=1&_sid=a1ff8c325&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book.
## About the Book
'Practical Full-Stack Machine Learning' introduces data professionals to a set of powerful, open-source tools and concepts required to build a complete data science project. This book is written in Python, and the ML solutions are language-neutral and can be applied to various software languages and concepts.

The book covers data pre-processing, feature management, selecting the best algorithm,  model performance optimization, exposing ML models as API endpoints, and scaling ML API. It helps you learn how to use cookiecutter to create reusable project structures and templates. It explains DVC so that you can implement it and reap the same benefits in ML projects.It also covers DASK and how to use it to create scalable solutions for pre-processing data tasks. KerasTuner, an easy-to-use, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of hyperparameter search will be covered in this book. It explains ensemble techniques such as bagging, stacking, and boosting methods and the ML-ensemble framework to easily and effectively implement ensemble learning. 
The book also covers how to use Airflow to automate your ETL tasks for data preparation. It explores MLflow, which allows you to train, reuse, and deploy models created with any library. It teaches how to use fastAPI to expose and scale ML models as API endpoints.
